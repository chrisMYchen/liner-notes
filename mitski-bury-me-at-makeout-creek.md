# Mitski - Bury Me At Makeout Creek

what a fab album title!

## Texas Reznikoff
- interesting first track, setting the tone, starting some kind of story i feel like probably a concept album
- contrast from folk-like intro to the thumping, distorted second chorus wakes you up. escaping from the fond memories to rage, rage at what? 
- 7/10 first track - sets a scene. some relationship 

## Townie
- reminds me of the latest Rina album! the speak-sing and unhinged melodic line, hard instrumental, and sort of casting off the past and people and perceptions
- fascinating melodic line in contrast with the rage and anger in the instrumental and delivery/subject matter. yelling these cutesy lines!

## First Love/Late Spring
- This album really has some forward bass in the mix
- The chorus coming. Fkin slaps! Damn! 
- So untraditional, fresh. Takes a few listens to be comforted by it, but then it's like "let's get itttttt gurrl!"
- The ear candy, synth in second verse. Really interesting choice of sound! Contrast with the "droning" rest of instrumentation and lead vocal line - really draws attention 
- Ayyyy! Truck driver gear change. But just in the instrumental first - pretty fresh take on it. 

## Francis Forever
- Addicted to these primarily bass line driven instrumentals. Guitar just mirrors
- Melody line just goes and goes and goes - interesting effect for when it finally gets to a break at the end of the song. 
- P fire 

## I Don't Smoke
- FAT distortion -> Just a fascinating choice for the genre and the vocals. Really distinct. 
- Crazy vocal line at the beginning
- The clap makes me laugh lol interesting drum kit choice
- I enjoy how the song fits in the course of the album a lot! Great middle of album song 

## Jobless Monday
- Love this melody line. So addictive
- Holy this synth solo sound is crazy
- And BOOM right into the key change , fascinating it just continues... TAKE ME OUT
- Man it's gooood gotta listen again 
- Sounds just a little bit creepy to be interesting but it's just fire

## Drunk Walk Home
- These drums just sound freaking awesome damn
- Holy the screams we are on a trip!!
- This album is good AF

## I Will
- UUEEHBGH bass bass BASS
- I love the tender vocals in comparison to the raw bass line, and in contrast with the rest of the album so far. Such a nicely slotted in composition 
- Desperation
- Don't like the resolution at the end of the song though - wish it didn't resolve and just lingered ... such pace from the bass line. Let me linger!

## Carry Me Out
- Same structure - folk instrumental opening verse into heavy chorus
- Feels like the end montage of a movie! 

## Last Words of a Shooting Star
- Peak sad girl! 
- Still prefer carry me out as ending track but it's nice!
- Ending credits song
- Exactly the ending of the story of Texas Reznikoff


Ahhh! What a great album. Concept album ❤️
