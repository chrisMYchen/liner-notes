# taylor swift - midnights
## lavender haze
- songwriting feels like lover album?
- fun synth bass
- reputation type feel tho

## maroon
- big droneeeee
- i guess this is a “pop album”
- is this talking about uchicago??? lol
- red energy colorz
- this feels like 1989
- the chorus ending is like new years day: and the memories they will hold onto you


## anti-hero*
- like the singing tone/lyrics + pronunciation fit voice more here!!
- these snares so poppy very 1989 energy
- ant-eh hero
- woah cool ear candy wubwubwub vocoder?
- this chorus/outro is funny lol “hi”

## snow on the beach
- nice lana energy! but WHERE IS LANA lol!
- the ad libs are nice!
- these bridges i don’t really like these days D: idk just all pretty boring and similar
- i don’t really like this phrase “snow on a beach” but maybe jsut needs to grow on me. but i guess that’s the point the cognitive dissonance
- sad feat for lana

## you’re on your own, kid
- new kinda guitar energy cool feels like start to calvin harris or smtn lol
- all these pumping drums every track
- loooool that baby riser was dope
- nice sound design moment instrumental break gud 1 lorde screachy
- cool journey song here
- enjoy how it just ends

## midnight rain
- woahhh the formant shift noice one taylor fun 
- the verse sounds like clean —> drought was the very worst
- i do not like this chorus D:
- radio fade is that even cool anymore?

## question
- more formant shift!
- i like the verse
- just not enjoying these choruses… how to describe them? 
- i feel like the production so far is all very much same-y (inter songs and intra song, not a ton of tension + release aside from like bigger drums) —> guess it’s really focused on the singing, but also the singing performances themselves don’t do that 
- this bridge is the worst lol
- these taylor swift ‘ohhhs’ ugh breathy voice D:

## vigilante shit
- nice reputation energy
- synths and perc are dope here
- i feel like this song feels limited by her vocal performance doesn’t hold up to the production D:

## bejeweled
- not enjoying how she jams in syllables these days D: 
- and the like everything sta cc a to
- NICE! —> put this on a soundboard
- this song is like wid ya girls a lil funny “ayy” “shimmer”!
- made me laugh so yay

## labyrinth
- interesting chorus break
- lol i’m just thinking of honeymoon avenue “HONEYMOON AVENUE” w/ the pitch shift
- idk chorus just feels uninspired 

## karma
- back to present, in the front vocals
- reminds me of reputation type stuff 
- lol i’m still here —> uh oh uh oh uh oh from lover me
- this one’s fun. i think it just owns it being fun which makes it more fun :) 

## sweet nothing*
- seems promising from the start! now more folklore type energy/ isn’t this like cardigan?invisible string?
- the production is like that one song 
- yuh the horns coming thru
- i think this was a nice latter half album track change of pace
- still wish there was more push and pull in the performance tho -> but it’s homey and quaint like that

## mastermind
- arrrrrrrrpp
- nice i like the sound design a lot here
- i think the beginning is quite good
- it’s aight. i think the words end up a bit clunky but nothing out of the ordinary these days i guess
- man really wanted to like this one after the first verse! but i dunno it just flopped going on from there

## overall:
- overall feels like an interesting mix of b-side tracks from past albums (reputation/lover/1989/folklore)
- anti hero, karma, mb lavender haze gonna b the popular ones?
- i like antihero, you’re on your own kid, sweet nothing the most as of now
